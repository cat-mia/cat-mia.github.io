My current research interests are **financial AI agents** utilizing a **multi-agent system**, agent simulation and optimization, and **knowledge graph** generation for industrial AI agents.

I'm currenty a SDE, International Risk Management, [AntGroup](https://www.antgroup.com/en). Our group responsibility is to build AI-enhanced financial risk control systems.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) as an Outstanding Graduate and my final year project won the Excellent Thesis Award (Thesis).

Then I received my master's degree in Computer Science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Haisheng Tan](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hstan/home.html), who helped me build strong confidence in both my research and my overall life.

I have worked on system for deep learning under the supervision of [Dr. Zhenhua Han](https://hzhua.github.io/), [Microsoft Research Asia(MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/). During my internship, I also collaborate with Microsoft Azure(Raymond) using reinforcement learning methods to optimize cloud costs.

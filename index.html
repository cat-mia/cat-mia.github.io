<p class="Section">2 &ensp; Introduction</p>
<p class="BodyText">
My academic path began with a passion for how algorithms influence real-world behavior.
<br>
After earning my master's degree from <strong>University of Science and Technology of China</strong> and participating in research at <strong>Microsoft Research Asia</strong>, I became interested in how AI could not only <em>predict</em>, but also <em>act</em> ‚Äî in complex, dynamic environments.
<p class="BodyText">
Now, I design and evaluate methods that bring intelligence to operations: from data-driven supply chain decision-making to resilient global sourcing strategies.
